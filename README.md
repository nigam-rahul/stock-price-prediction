## Conclusion and Future Scope

**<u>Based on the evaluation metrics calculated</u>:**

- Leveraged regression and tree-based models, reducing ***Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)*** significantly to **2.19%** using ***Holt's Exponential method*** compared to 43.35% in SVM regression.
- Enhanced model performance, achieving up to **94%** improvement in ***Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)*** by transitioning from SVM (758.72) to Holt's Exponential method (43.13).
- Integrated advanced exponential smoothing techniques like ***Holt-Winter's Additive***, further refining accuracy with ***Mean Absolute Error (MAE)*** reduced to **38.38** from 757.23 in SVM.
- Delivered robust predictive solutions, achieving substantial R-squared score gains, showcasing expertise in forecasting and regression modeling approaches.


The Stock Price Prediction Web App demonstrates the integration of data engineering, machine learning, and user-centric design. Its robust architecture and reliable predictions offer significant utility for forecasting tasks and highlight practical implementation skills.

The changes in the stock market are not always be in a regular pattern or not always follow the continuous cycle. Based on the companies and sectors, the existence of the trends and the period of their existence will differ. The analysis of this type of cycles and trends can offer a more profit to the investors.

In future work, I would like to add more complex models to improve accuracy of predicted stock price. For better accuracy, model can be trained with more varied and detailed data. Also, other strategies along with proposed ones can be used to create a new hybrid model.
